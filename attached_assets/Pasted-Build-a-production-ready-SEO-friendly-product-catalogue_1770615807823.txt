Build a production-ready SEO-friendly product catalogue web app (PWA style so it feels like an app on mobile) for brand: "monipack" (IMPORTANT: the “m” must always be lowercase everywhere).

Tech stack:
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- PostgreSQL (use environment variables for DB URL)
- Drizzle ORM (or Prisma if easier) + migrations
- Auth: Google OAuth + email OTP (6-digit pin) as second step
- Roles: SUPER_ADMIN (developer), ADMIN
- SEO: server-rendered pages, dynamic sitemap.xml, robots.txt, meta tags, OpenGraph, fast performance

Brand UI:
- Main brand color: Rich Red (create a theme token and use consistently)
- Modern clean interface, best UX on mobile and desktop
- Header with logo, navigation, search, categories dropdown
- Homepage: hero banner + carousel (developer-only editable), category tiles, featured products
- Footer: business legal name, support email, social links/icons (Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, WhatsApp channel, X)
- Font placeholder: provide instructions to add my custom font later via /public/fonts and Tailwind config. Until then use a clean default font.

Front-end (public users):
- Products show: images (minimum 3 images per product), product name, part number, descriptions, category tags, optional price
- Category pages (SEO-friendly URLs)
- Search + filters (category, availability)
- No checkout.
- Cart exists ONLY to collect multiple products, then user taps “Send Inquiry on WhatsApp”.
- Cart supports quantity per item.
- IMPORTANT: Remove user-entered contact name and phone number fields completely. Do not collect or store customer phone/name.
- WhatsApp message must include:
  - First line: "Please share your name, phone number, and delivery location."
  - Then list of products with name + part number + quantity
  - Source info: timestamp and page URL
- WhatsApp integration: open wa.me link using WHATSAPP_NUMBER env var, prefilled message.

Back-end / Admin panel:
- Route group /admin protected.
- Login flow:
  1) Google sign-in (only allow emails listed in admins table OR ADMIN_ALLOWLIST env)
  2) After Google login, require 6-digit OTP sent to that email (valid for 10 minutes, one-time use).
- Each admin has unique credentials and cannot access other admin accounts.
- SUPER_ADMIN (developer) can access everything.

Permissions (STRICT):
- SUPER_ADMIN (developer) ONLY:
  - Manage carousel/banners (create/edit/reorder/enable-disable)
  - Manage admin users (create/disable, set role)
  - View and edit all products and categories
  - View audit logs and per-admin performance
- ADMIN users:
  - Products: create/edit/toggle ON/OFF products, upload images
  - Categories: create/edit/reorder/enable-disable categories
  - Cannot access carousel/banners
  - Can only see their own dashboard stats/performance
  - Product access rule: ADMIN can edit ONLY products they created (createdBy matches their admin id). SUPER_ADMIN can edit all.

Admin product upload rules:
- Required fields: product name, part number, description, category, minimum 3 images
- Optional: price
- Instantly publish: any product uploaded/edited by admin and set ON must appear immediately on the public site.
- Any product can be turned OFF/ON (ADMIN only for their own products; SUPER_ADMIN for all).

Category rules:
- Fields: name, slug (auto-generated + editable), sort order, status ON/OFF
- Slug must be unique, SEO-friendly
- Reordering supported
- If category is OFF, hide it from public navigation and category pages.

Admin dashboard:
- ADMIN dashboard shows their progress:
  - total products created
  - active products
  - disabled products
  - categories created/managed
- SUPER_ADMIN dashboard shows global stats + per-admin stats

Data + auditing:
- Store createdBy admin id for products and categories
- Audit logs for: login events, OTP requests, product create/update/toggle, category create/update/reorder/toggle, banner changes (super only)

Security + quality:
- Server-side authorization checks for every admin action (API + pages)
- Validate inputs (zod)
- Rate limit OTP requests
- Store OTP hashed (never plain)
- Use secure cookies/session
- Image uploads:
  - Must enforce minimum 3 images per product.
  - Use a Replit-friendly storage approach. If local storage is used, clearly document persistence limits and provide an upgrade path (S3/R2/Supabase Storage).
- High performance, responsive, accessible UI.

Deliverables in the code:
- Database schema + migrations
- Public pages: /, /products, /products/[slug], /category/[slug]
- Admin pages: /admin, /admin/products, /admin/categories, /admin/banners (super only), /admin/admins (super only)
- API routes for all CRUD with role checks
- README with setup steps, env vars, run commands, and deploy steps, plus how to add custom font later.

Environment variables required:
- DATABASE_URL
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET (or equivalent)
- OTP_EMAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY (Resend or similar) and FROM_EMAIL
- WHATSAPP_NUMBER (international format, no +)
- SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL
- Optional: ADMIN_ALLOWLIST (comma-separated emails)

Important naming rules:
- Always display brand name as "monipack"
- Do not capitalize the “m” anywhere.
