PROMPT FOR REPLIT (COPY–PASTE)

Task: Update navbar + add Retail Outlets & Warehouses modules + show search bar only on Products page

Navbar changes

Replace navbar links with:

Home (/)

Products (/products)

Retail Outlets (/retail-outlets)

Warehouses (/warehouses)

Contact Us (/contact)

Career (/career)

Remove “Catalogue”

Remove “Categories”

Search bar behavior

The search bar must appear ONLY on /products page.

On all other pages (Home, Retail Outlets, Warehouses, etc.) the search bar must be hidden.

If the search input currently lives in Header.tsx, move it to Products page OR render it conditionally based on route.

Retail Outlets page

Create page /retail-outlets with cards/list layout.

Each outlet must show:

Outlet name

Outlet image (uploaded by Super Admin)

Google Maps link (open in new tab)

Mobile number (click-to-call)

Working hours (e.g., “Sat–Thu 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM”)

Design should be clean/professional, same visual style as product cards.

Warehouses page

Create page /warehouses with the same format as Retail Outlets:

Warehouse name

Warehouse image (uploaded by Super Admin)

Google Maps link

Mobile number

Working hours

Admin panel

Add a separate admin section like Products for:

Retail Outlets management: /admin/retail-outlets

Warehouses management: /admin/warehouses

Super Admin can:

Add / Edit / Delete outlet/warehouse

Upload image for each one (same upload pipeline used for product photos)

Toggle Active (active only shown on public pages)

Public pages must show only Active entries.

Backend / DB

Create DB tables and API endpoints similar to products:

retail_outlets table: id, name, imageUrl, mapUrl, phone, hours, isActive, createdAt, updatedAt

warehouses table: same fields

Endpoints:

GET /api/retail-outlets (public: active only)

GET /api/warehouses (public: active only)

GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/retail-outlets

GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/warehouses

Make sure image URLs resolve correctly from uploads/public.

Final check

After implementation:

Products page shows search bar

Other pages hide it

Retail Outlets and Warehouses pages load data from DB

Admin can upload images and manage records

Navigation works correctly

Super important (so you don’t get “broken image”)

For outlet/warehouse images, use the same approach you used for banners/products (store imageUrl from upload response and render it directly).
